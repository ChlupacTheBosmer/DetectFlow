## Introduction
<p>Welcome. Here you can find basic tutorial on how to use this database view.</p>
<p>The model generates predictions on a per frame basis. Working with this data can be cumbersome and overwhelming.
For that reason we can process this data into coherent visits. Since the predictions ca nbe noisy and inconsistent
across frames, this process included quite a bit of alchemy. The aim of this app is to help you process the raw results
into these visits data and if possible filter out at least some of the false positives and other noise.</p>

## 1. Generating Visits
<p>When you open the app, you will see a table with the visits data. This data is generated from the raw predictions.
You can see the start and end time of the visit, the video_id and the visit_id. The visit_id is a unique identifier of the visit.</p>

## 2. Filtering Visits
<p>There are several ways to filter the visits. You can filter by the video_id, the start time, the end time, the visit_id or any combination of these.
You can also sort the visits by any of these columns. You can also filter the visits by the video_id.</p>

## 3. Editing Visits
<p>You can edit the visits by clicking on the cell you want to edit. You can edit the start time, the end time, the video_id or the visit_id.
You can also add new visits by clicking on the last row of the table. You can also delete visits by clicking on the row you want to delete.</p>

## 4. Saving Visits
<p>When you are done editing the visits, you can save the visits by clicking on the save button. This will save the visits to the database.</p>
